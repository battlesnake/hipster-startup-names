HIPSTER STARTUP NAMES
=====================

Author: Mark K Cowan, mark@battlesnake.co.uk, github.com/battlesnake

Basically, just clone this pile of crap onto a Linux computer with aspell available, then run:

	./select.sh

to generate the name of your shitty new startup.

---

Example one-linear, generating five future unicorns:

	$ for x in {1..5}; do ./select.sh ; done
	seismographr.io
	teletypewritr.io
	nonusr.io
	lithographr.io
	notepapr.io

---

Or to run the glorious web server _written in Bash for HackerNews points_ on port 1234:

	port=1234 ./server.sh

Good luck stopping it though.
